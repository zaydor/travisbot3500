# Web Watch
Let us keep an eye on the web for you.

This is the first mobile application that has came out of Zaydor Studios, the team that consists of the solo software developing champion, Isaiah Dorado (me).

This app was made in Java using Android Studio.

Link to download -> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zaydorstudios.webwatch (The free version is still in development, you could totally just rip the app from here, but that would be immoral. But who will ever know? Not me. But I might have a slight pain in my chest from the pirate life you have chosen. No big deal.)

# About
Web Watch is an app that will notify you when it detects a change on any website that you give it.

Web Watch does this by creating a new thread that will call an in-house api to request the HTML of the page that you are wanting to track. After x amount of time, the app will do the process again and compare the original HTML with the new HTML and see if there were any changes. If there is changes, the app will send a notification to you, informing you to check out the website.

Currently, Web Watch not only requires the URL for the website you want to "watch", but you also need to know the "id" of the HTML section that you want to track. So some basic knowledge of HTML and inspect element is also needed.

Web Watch was made for fun and for general practice with using Java as well as being able to work on a project from start to finish. I do not guarantee that Web Watch is free of bugs/issues that causes you to miss out on something important.
Because of this, please do not solely rely on Web Watch for your website tracking needs.

# How to Use
There is a convenient tutorial inside the app for users to view. Or you can just check out a simplified version here:

1) Download Web Watch
2) Find a website you want to track and get the ID of a 'good' element
3) Input the URL and ID into Web Watch
4) Input the time interval that you would like Web Watch to check the website
5) Select "submit"
6) You will be taken to the timer screen which will show when the next check will be made is. You can now sit back and relax while Web Watch does the checking for you.
7) Congratulations, you are now a Web Watch expert!

# Features (Web Watch Pro vs Web Watch Free)
Of course there has to be incentives on paying the extra 99 cents for Web Watch Pro. Here is where I will lay out the features that you get by upgrading.

<ins>Web Watch Free</ins>
* Track any website you want
* Web Watch will check the website every x minutes you provide
* A notification will send prompting you to check out the website for the changes
* Really cool splash screen
* Really cool tutorial

<ins>Web Watch Pro</ins>

Everything in Web Watch Free, plus:
* Save your URL/ID history!
* Add multiple websites and/or ids to be tracked in the same session
* *SOON*: Change the length of the Web Watch session

# Future Updates
I have future updates planned to improve the experience of Web Watch. Here is a taste of some upcoming plans I had in mind:
* Improved UI
* Pressing Enter on the keyboard after entering the URL/ID/Time will go to the next page, instead of having to press submit
* Able to change the length of the Web Watch session
* General bug fixes
